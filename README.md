# Project Title: AIMM
AIMM = Am I Making Money? (Capstone Project for GA)

## Description
As a business owner, as a consultant, or as a project manager, there are many questions that need to be answered. 
What needs to be done today? Where are we headed? When will this project be completed?

But at the end of the day, the only question that matters to stakeholders isâ€¦
AM I MAKING MONEY?

No matter the industry, everyone's AIMM is the same. To be profitable.

This app was made to create a simple, easy to use, financial dashboard for trade professionals, who need a quick way to monitoring their cash flow (revenue & expenses) for a given project/job.

This app is designed to keep track of whether or not a project is making money. A user can create individual project records, and can set a budget for each project. The app also allows the user to list expenses and income for each respective project. Expenses can be categorized. An alert can be triggered when expenses exceed the set budget.
